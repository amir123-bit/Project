 SnakeHead Sprite:

when green flag clicked
go to x: (0) y: (0)
set [Score v] to (0)
set [SnakeLength v] to (0)
set [Direction v] to [right]
delete this clone
forever
  if <key [up arrow] pressed?> then
    set [Direction v] to [up]
  end
  if <key [down arrow] pressed?> then
    set [Direction v] to [down]
  end
  if <key [left arrow] pressed?> then
    set [Direction v] to [left]
  end
  if <key [right arrow] pressed?> then
    set [Direction v] to [right]
  end
  create clone of [myself v]
  wait (0.2) seconds
end

when I start as a clone
if <(Direction) = [up]> then
  change y by (10)
end
if <(Direction) = [down]> then
  change y by (-10)
end
if <(Direction) = [left]> then
  change x by (-10)
end
if <(Direction) = [right]> then
  change x by (10)
end
wait (SnakeLength) * 0.2 seconds
delete this clone

 Apple Sprite:

when green flag clicked
go to [random position v]
show

forever
  if <touching [SnakeHead v]?> then
    change [Score v] by (1)
    change [SnakeLength v] by (1)
    go to [random position v]
  end
end

 (Optional) Game Over Logic (Collision):

if <touching [edge v]> then
  say [Game Over!] for (2) seconds
  stop [all]

 Game Complete!

Run the project and:

Use arrow keys to move

Eat apples to grow

Each segment is a clone that disappears after a short time



---

Would you like:

The downloadable .sb3 file?

The same game made in Blockly or Node-RED?


Let me know and I can generate that for you.if <touching [edge v]> then
  say [Game Over!] for (2) seconds
  stop [all]
